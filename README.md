# Spinner Simulation

This is a simulation for the effect of rotating objects being seen as rotating backwards. It can be observed because the eye catches only roughly 25 FPS (frames per second). If the spinning object rotates with a frequency of a bit less than that the eye catches a bit less than one rotation per frame. Based on this the brain concludes that the object turns backwards even though it doesn't.
